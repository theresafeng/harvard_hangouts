* TODO

- Paginate posts on the main page
- Posts should be associated to the user
	- I think the problem here is that we didn't set up the relationship between Users and Hangouts correctly.. I don't understand Devise, so I don't know how we would go about fixing this
- User can only edit/delete own posts
- Clean up hangouts
- Put something instead when no posts are available or if user can't see any
- Disallow users to post blank comments
- Add AM/PM and possibly different day to time
